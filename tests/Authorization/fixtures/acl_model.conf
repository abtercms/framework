[request_definition]
# A request must contain a subject, an object, and an action
r = sub, obj, act

[policy_definition]
# A policy is made up of a subject, an object, and an action - same as a request in this case
p = sub, obj, act

[policy_effect]
# Action will be allowed if there's at least one policy that allows it
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
# Match only if the request and the policy matches on all parts: subject, object and action
# In practice if the policy says Alice can Pick Mushrooms
# then a request for Alice to Pick Mushrooms will be a match
# but a request for Bob to Pick Mushrooms will not be a match
# and a request for Alice to Eat Mushrooms also won't be a match
# and furthermore a request for Alice to Pick Flowers is also not a match
m = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
