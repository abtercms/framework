[request_definition]
# A request must contain a subject, an object, and an action
r = sub, obj, act

[policy_definition]
# A policy rule is made up of a subject, an object, and an action - same as a request in this case
p = sub, obj, act

#  the definition for the RBAC role inheritance relations
[role_definition]
# A group consists of two pieces: a user and a role
g = _, _

[policy_effect]
# Action will be allowed if there's at least one policy that allows it
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
# Match only the request and the policy rule subjects belonging to the same group if and only if
# the request object matches the policy rule object and
# the request action matches the pattern defined in the policy rule
#
# In practice this means that if Alice is a Reader and we have rule that says:
# Readers can Pick (PICK) Mushrooms (/mushrooms/:resource), then a request in the form of
# Alice PICK /mushrooms/shroom will be allowed
m = g(r.sub, p.sub) && keyMatch2(r.obj, p.obj) && regexMatch(r.act, p.act)
