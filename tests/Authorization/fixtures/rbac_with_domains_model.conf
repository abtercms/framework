[request_definition]
# A request must contain a subject, a domain, an object, and an action
r = sub, dom, obj, act

[policy_definition]
# A policy rule is made up of a subject, a domain, an object, and an action - same as a request in this case
p = sub, dom, obj, act

[role_definition]
# A group consists of 3 pieces: a user, a role and a tenant (or domain)
g = _, _, _

[policy_effect]
# Action will be allowed if there's at least one policy that allows it
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
# Match only the request and the policy rule subjects belonging to the same group if and only if
# the request domain is the same as the policy rule domain,
# the request object is the same as the policy rule object
# the request action is the same as the policy rule action
#
# In practice this means that if Alice is a Reader on Site1, and we have rule that says:
# Readers can Pick (PICK) Mushrooms (/mushrooms/shroom) on Site1, then a request in the form of
# Alice Site1 PICK /mushrooms/shroom will be allowed
m = g(r.sub, p.sub, r.dom) && r.dom == p.dom && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
